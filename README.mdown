## ELM-COLLISIONS

The present repository contains a collection of examples illustrating *Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)* in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).

## INSTRUCTIONS

The current version of Elm is 0.16. In case you do not have Elm installed on your machine yet, the simplest way to test the *.elm files is at [http://elm-lang.org/try](http://elm-lang.org/try) where you can cut-and-paste the raw code and compile it.
